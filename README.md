# Budget Management Application

This is a React-based web application that allows users to manage personal budgets and expenses. Users can create, update, and delete budgets and track expenses associated with those budgets.

## Features

- **Add Budgets**: Create new budgets with a name and an amount.
- **Edit Budgets**: Update the name and amount of existing budgets.
- **Delete Budgets**: Remove budgets and their associated expenses.
- **Track Expenses**: Manage expenses under specific budgets and view total expenses.
- **Dashboard Overview**: View a summary of total budgets, expenses, and remaining balances.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For handling client-side routing.
- **React Toastify**: For displaying notifications (success, error messages).
- **JSON Server (optional)**: Can be used for a simple mock backend to simulate CRUD operations.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for the user interface.
- **Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Optionally, a backend server or JSON Server for mock API responses.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/budget-management-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd budget-management-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server, and you can view the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Optional: Setting Up JSON Server

If you want to mock the backend with JSON Server:

1. Install JSON Server:

   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server
   ```

2. Create a `db.json` file with the following structure:

   ```json
   {
     "budgets": [],
     "expenses": []
   }
   ```

3. Start JSON Server:

   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
   ```

   The mock server will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.

### API Endpoints

Here are the main API endpoints used in the project:

- **GET /budgets**: Fetch all budgets.
- **POST /budgets**: Create a new budget.
- **PUT /budgets/{id}**: Update an existing budget.
- **DELETE /budgets/{id}**: Delete a budget.

- **GET /expenses**: Fetch all expenses.
- **POST /expenses**: Create a new expense.
- **DELETE /expenses/{id}**: Delete an expense.

## Usage

1. **Add Budgets**: Navigate to the "Add Budget" page to create a new budget. Enter a name and amount, then click "Add Budget".
2. **Manage Budgets**: View your existing budgets below the form. You can edit or delete any budget.
3. **Track Expenses**: Go to the "Manage Expenses" page to add expenses to specific budgets. You can also delete expenses.
4. **Dashboard**: The dashboard provides an overview of your total budgets, expenses, and remaining balances.

## Styles and UI

The application is styled with custom CSS to provide a clean and modern user interface. It includes responsive design elements to ensure the app works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Global Styles

- **Buttons**: Styled with gradients and hover effects.
- **Forms**: Styled input fields and select dropdowns for budget and expense creation.
- **Lists**: Budget and expense lists with hover animations.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, you can build the app and host it on any static hosting provider like GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify.

1. **Build the project:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the `build/` folder** to your hosting provider.
